What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A file called .git is created! You need to do this so git can track your commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is not an actual space on the drive, nothing is saved yet. this provides the oppertunity to connect to files logically and tell the repos how they are connected.
